# WEhealth
The project is made by considering the impact on people when they are staring at screens, screen light and glare, improper viewing distances, and poor posture that can cause computer vision syndrome. Symptoms related to prolonged screen time include eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. The people are so engrossed in their work that they forget about their surrounding and even their body. This extension is designed to tell the people periodically to blink to avoid eye strain, drink water to stay hydrated, correct their posture and do some stretching if they are sitting on their pc/laptop for too long.
